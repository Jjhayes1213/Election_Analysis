# Election_Analysis

## Overview
The election analysis goal is to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee 
with an audit of all counted data of votes counted in the assigned US Congressional
Precinct.  We were provided a csv file countaining the results of the election ballots for the district. We analyzed data for the Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe conties.  County level located the area with largest voter.  The Candidate review allowed us to assess the winner based on popular vote count and percentage of votes.

##Summary
To run this analysis we used the Python on Visual Studio for the coding.  This is a
template that could be used on a larger scale of election analsis with some minor adjustments.  This data was whole, so the script can be modified to find data that has missing information.  We can then calculate how many ballots were recieved that were not filled out properly.  This count could be use to commisioner leadership to lead tactical teams to provide education and encourage voters to fill out their ballots properly.  Also if the data is provided with the total count of all registered voters for each county, code can be adjusted for further insight.  The total registered voters data can be compared to the total votes for the county, and then analyze the percentage of the county that did vote.  With this data, the electoral commisons can focus on providing information to counties that have a low voter turnout, to encourage voting in the future.
